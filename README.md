##### Configuration files (laptop, hostname=freedom)


#### Vim

I use spf13-vim : Steve Francia's Vim Distribution, which is available at 
https://github.com/spf13/spf13-vim/

In addition to that, I used some extra plugins and disabled others. I also 
hacked a bit in the original file, so the end result will slightly differ from 
my own, but I can assure is no big deal. Also, as a warning, my .vimrc's are a 
total mess, poorly commented and with a lot of dead trial-and-error code. Sorry 
for that, will fix when time will allow it.

In order to get it, you will have to follow Steve's instructions at the above 
link, then get the .vimrc files from my own and add them to your home directory.


#### Awesome WM

Not much to say, really. Wallpaper set by nitrogen, since it manages greatly any 
number of screens and can stretch the pic if needed. A screenshot can be found 
at http://www.zimagez.com/zimage/screenshot-03052013-110027pm.php


#### zsh

I only use it for two days now, so not ush of a config, mostly oh-my-zsh from 
https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh and plugins activation. But I intend 
to extend it as much as I need to :-)


#### Various configuration items

My .Xdefaults and .Xresources files (only Xdefaults is active nowadays), for 
configuring various aspects of default appplication appearance. (u)rxvt, xclock, 
default terminal font for xterm and other evilvte terminals, and some more 
goodies.


#### Fonts

I used to enjoy Proggy Clean for coding, but now I don't care that much anymore. 
I just attached a few more frequently used ones here, all of them redistributable 
under free licenses. Besides two or three system default fonts (Liberation and 
DejaVu families), my documents and configs revolve around those typefaces.
